#Title : Election Audit and discussion of information needed by the Colorado Board of Elections

#Overview of Election Audit

The project is to  complete the election audit, and discuss the information needed by the Colorado Board of Elections.
The process was facilitated by employing the technique commonly used by programmers to write steps of their code, 
which is called pseudocode. In this process;  if statement to get the unique names of the candidates list was created , 
votes counted  for each candidate in the if statement as we iterate through the rows of the CSV file. Codes for decision 
statement to compare the number of votes each candidate received were effectively written and used. 

#Election Audit Results

  Our final Python script delivered the following information: 
  
    • Total number of votes cast : 
            369,699
            
            
   • List of candidates who received votes : 
          Charles Casper Stockham,  
          Diana DeGette and 
          Raymon Anthony Doane
          
          
   • Total number of votes each candidate received
          Charles Casper Stockham: 85,201
          Diana DeGette: 272,892
          Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606
          
    •	Percentage of votes each candidate won
          Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% 
          Diana DeGette: 73.8% 
          Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% 
          
    •	The winner of the election based on popular vote
          Winner: Diana DeGette
          Winning Vote Count: 272,892
          Winning Percentage: 73.8%
          
    •	The voter turnout for each county 
          Jefferson: 38,843
          Denver: 306,055
          Arapahoe: 24,801
    •	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
          Jefferson: 10.5% 
          Denver: 82.8% 
          Arapahoe: 6.7% 
          
    •	The county with the highest turnout
          Denver: 306,055

# Election Audit Summary
   This  task determines the winning candidate by the number and percentage of votes.
   Te election audit summary compares the number of votes each candidate received; Diana DeGett with 272,892 of the total vote has the highest of the total in
   all the votes with calculated the vote percentages 73.8% . 
   
   In addition was very clear that Denver county as the hoighest vote as a region with a significan difference from the votes from other counties(  Jefferson: 10.5%  and 
   Arapahoe: 6.7% )The winner therefore , based on the votes coming from Denver as county and the total vote accrued , is Diana DeGette
   
  The activities above were intitiated and employed the use of a pseudocode process that ensures detailed writing of codes for easier presentation of results to the               nontechnical colleagues and stakeholders
  When we execute this code, we get the overall election results, each candidate's results, and the winning candidate summary printed to the terminal in VS Code, as well as       saved to the election_results.txt file
  
 Most importatntly, the election commission agrees that the scrpts will continously offers the opportunity to add neew election details and still have results in the same   format with little modications and improvement .
  Therefore, it becomes a vital tools in strategic planning for devvelopment, infrastructure and budget allocations.
